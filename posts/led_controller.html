              This is a project I've been wanting to do for a very long time,
              but never had the time or knowledge to finish it properly. The
              idea of a simple color wheel with which I could control a RGB
              LEDstrip has been on my mind since I got my first ESP8266 module.
              When attempting this project I ran into the project of finding a
              suitable color picker as I knew nothing about javascript. But when
              my sister asked me to make some LEDstrips so she could attach them
              to her ceiling I knew the time had come to finally make it real.
              The complete project can be found
              <a href="https://github.com/ProAce/led_controller">here</a> on my
              GitHub page.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">How does it work?</h2>

            <p>
              This project is based around a simple HTML page served to a
              connecting client which then communicates via GET and POST
              requests with the host, an ESP8266 module. The color wheel is made
              using <a href="https://iro.js.org/">this</a> brilliant library
              which made the color picking a whole lot easier. By implementing
              one of the event triggers it was possible to send a message to the
              ESP8266 when a color was chosen. A picked color is stored and send
              in a JSON format. This made it easy to extract on the host's side.
              Beneath you find a functional example of the webpage.
            </p>

            <div class="led_controller">
              <div class="c" id="cW"></div>

              <div class="c">
                <button onclick="leds_off()" class="btn">
                  Turn LED's off
                </button>
                <button onclick="leds_on()" class="btn">
                  Turn LED's on
                </button>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              On the ESP8266's side I made use of the excellent WebServer
              library available. I registered two functions to be called when a
              POST or GET request was received on /led. For any other files the
              SPIFFS file system was used. When a message was received that was
              not registered to a function, the ESP8266 would look in its file
              system if that file existed and otherwise send a 404 error. This
              made it easy to upload new files without erasing the firmware.
            </p>

            <p>
              The POST request accepted a JSON message containing the R, G, and
              B values. These got extracted and stored in a global variable.
              When a GET request was received, these global variables were
              repackaged in a JSON message and returned to the client. This made
              it possible to set the color wheel to the current color when a new
              client connected. The last thing to do was write the globals to
              the PWM outputs in the main loop.
            </p>

            <p>
              When implementing this controller in my sisters room I ran into a
              problem. At first I had configured the color wheel to send a new
              color on every change. This meant that a ton of messages were send
              to the ESP8266 as you slide over the wheel. This made the module
              hang and eventually reboot. By changing this to only sending a
              color on the last choice it is much more stable.
